Dockerfile based on `php:5.6-fpm` +ODBC extension and Virtuoso ODBC configuration.

This image is built to be used in the Ontowiki Docker Compose setup: https://github.com/Dockerizing/OntoWiki.compose

If `php:5.6-fpm` is no longer available. As of my current knowledge that should be commit `fab49d4cb1c61e4f74c2dffe06961408212f054c` of the php image: https://github.com/docker-library/php/commit/fab49d4cb1c61e4f74c2dffe06961408212f054c (branch: 5.6-backport, tag: 5.6)
